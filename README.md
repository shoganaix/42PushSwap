## Push Swap
Push Swap is an algorithm project at school 42.

**The objective of this project is to SORT data on a stack with a limited set of instructions while minimizing the number of actions required**

## Radix
> Radix sort is a step-wise sorting algorithm that starts the sorting from the least significant digit of the input elements.

**Radix sort** is an integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and place value.

## Usage

To use the push_swap program, compile it with the `make` command and then run it with the list of integers to be sorted as arguments

```sh
./push_swap 3 1 2
```


## Grade
> This project got a **100**/100 in **_42_** school
